##  Standardize project wide definitions for galaxy observables

Summary -- Define the common observational properties that will need to be controlled and
validated (e.g. size, shape, flux, and light profile.)

### Key Tasks
* Key Task CS1.1.1 ( 12/15 ): Schedule and conduct a first meeting of interested parties to
identify the specific quantities that need to be standardized.
* Key Task CS1.1.2 ( 12/15 ): Assemble all standard methods for calculating identified
properties.
* Key Task CS1.1.3 ( 12/15 ): Deliver first version of document outlining galaxy properties
of interest (Confluence?).

#### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
